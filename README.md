## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to use publicly available New York City Citi Bike data (from August 2019) with Tableau data visualization to explore a potential bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.<br/>

Key statistics from the August 2019 Citi Bike data:
- 2.3m+ rides across NYC
- Of all the riders, 65% were male and 25% were female; the gender of the other 10% was unknown
- 81% of those users had a Citi Bike subscription
- The highest density of rides were taken in Manhattan

## Summary
Explain.</br>

Additional analyses such as (1) throughout different times of the year (perhaps one in each season) would show how the seasons and (2) weather affect Citi Bike usage. These analyses would help determine trends amongst customers and subscribers.
