## Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to use publicly available New York City Citi Bike data (from August 2019) with Tableau data visualization to explore a potential bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.<br/>

- 2.3m+ rides across NYC
- Of all the riders, 65% were male and 25% were female; the gender of the other 10% was unknown

## Summary
One drawback of the webpage is that there is no filtering of searches. For example, if a user enters any inputs that are not in the dataset, then the webpage shows a blank table instead of saying that there are no searches found.</br>

For further development of the webpage, it would be great if the dataset was even more comprehensive since it only includes data from the first two weeks of January 2010. I would also update the information formatting to have the cities, states, countries with proper capitalization. Another recommendation would be to show a dropdown of all values present in each column to enhance the user experience.
